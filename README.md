# Welcome to my frontend project!

## A deployed React app that mimics the functionality of Reddit

## Overview

As a part of my studies at Northcoders, I was tasked with building a front end app for my previously created backend. The intention is to mimic the functionality of forum sites like Reddit, while gaining practical knowledge for building a front end using React.

This app has been deployed to Vercel, and can be viewed online here. https://andrews-fe-project.vercel.app/
Alternatively, if you would like to run the app locally, please follow the setup instructions.

## Setup

Prerequisite: Node (version 16 or above)

First, clone the repo and head into the root directory:

git clone https://github.com/AndyTorr47/andrews-fe-project

cd fe-nc-news

Now install the project's dependencies:

npm install

The app can now be run locally:
